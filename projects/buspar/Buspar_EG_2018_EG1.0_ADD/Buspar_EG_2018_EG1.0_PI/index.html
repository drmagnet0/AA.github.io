            <b>Excipients</b><br> Colloidal silicon dioxide, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose
            and sodium starch glycolate<br>
            <b>PHARMACEUTICAL FORM</b><br> Buspirone hydrochloride, 10 mg, tablets<br> White flat with bisect in one side<br>            Buspirone hydrochloride, 15 mg tablets<br> White biconvex dividose<br>
            <b>CLINICAL INFORMATION</b><br>
            <b>Indications</b><br>
            <span>Buspirone hydrochloride is indicated for :</span><br> • the short term management of anxiety disorders<br>            • the relief of symptoms of anxiety with or without accompanying symptoms of depression.<br>
            <b>Dosage and Administration</b><br> The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 60 mg per day.<br> Food increases
            the bioavailability of buspirone. Buspirone should be taken at the same time each day and consistently with or
            without food.<br> If buspirone is administered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, the initial dose should be lowered
            and only increased gradually after medical evaluation (see Section<br> Interactions).<br> Grapefruit juice increases
            the plasma concentrations of buspirone. Patients taking buspirone should avoid consuming large quantities of
            grapefruit juice (see<br> Section Interactions).<br>
            <b>Route of Administration</b><br> For oral use.<br>
            <b>Adults</b><br> Dosage should be adjusted according to response for optimal efficacy and safety. The recommended
            initial dose is 5 mg two to three times<br> daily and this may be increased every two to three days. The usual
            therapeutic dose is 15 to 30 mg daily in divided doses with a maximum<br> recommended dose of 45 mg daily in
            divided doses.<br>
            <b>Children</b><br> Placebo-controlled trials, in which 334 patients were treated with buspirone for up to six
            weeks, have not shown buspirone at doses recommended for adults to<br> be an effective treatment for generalised
            anxiety disorder in patients less than 18 years (see Section Warnigs and Precautions).<br> Plasma concentrations
            of buspirone and its active metabolite were higher in paediatric patients, compared to adults given equivalent
            doses.<br>
            <b>Elderly</b><br> Current data do not support a change in dosage regimen based on age or sex of the patient.<br>
            <b>Renal impairment</b><br> After a single administration to patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency
            (creatinine clearance 20-49 ml/min/1.72 m2) a slight increase in the buspirone <br> blood levels was seen, without
            increase of the half-life time. In these patients buspirone should be administered with caution and a low dosage,
            two-times daily,<br> is advised. The response and the symptoms of the patients should be evaluated carefully,
            before an eventual increase of the dosage is made. A single <br> administration to anuretic patients causes an
            increase in the blood levels of the metabolite 1-pyrimidine/piperazine (1-PP), in which dialysis did not prove
            to<br> have any influence on the buspirone levels, neither on the 1-PP levels. Buspirone should not be administered
            to patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 20 <br> ml/min/1.72 m<sup>2</sup>), especially not to anuretic patients,
            because of the fact that increased and untreated levels of buspirone and its metabolites may occur.<br>
            <b>Hepatic impairment</b><br> As may be expected agents like buspirone used in patients with a reduced liver
            function show a reduced “first pass effect”. After a single administration to<br> patients with liver cirrhosis,
            higher maximum concentrations of unchanged buspirone are seen, with an increase in the half life time. In these
            patients buspirone <br> should be used with caution and individual dosages should be titrated with care to reduce
            the chance of central undesirable effects, which may occur because of <br> high maximum concentrations of buspirone.
            Increased dosages should be considered carefully and only after 4-5 days experience with the prior dosage.<br>
            <b>Contraindications</b><br> FBuspirone hydrochloride is contraindicated in:<br> • patients hypersensitive to
            buspirone hydrochloride or any of the excipients<br> • severe renal (creatinine clearance &lt;20 ml/min/1.72
            m2 or below) or severe hepatic insufficiency<br> • acute intoxication with alcohol, hypnotics, analgesics, or
            antipsychotic drugs.<br> • patients with epilepsy.<br>
            <b>Warnings and Precautions</b><br> Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors<br><br> The administration of buspirone to a
            patient taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) may pose a hazard. There have been reports of<br> the occurrence
            of elevated blood pressure when buspirone has been added to a regimen including a MAOI (phenelzine and tranylcypromine).
            Therefore, it is recommended that <br> buspirone not be used concomitantly with a MAOI.<br> Effects of concomitant
            use of alcohol on Psychomotor functions.<br><br> Alcohol use should be avoided during treatment with buspirone
            hydrochloride.<br> Although buspirone has not been reported to potentiate the psychomotor impairment produced
            by alcohol. No data are available on concomitant use of alcohol<br> and buspirone at single doses greater than
            20 mg.<br> Special precautions<br> Buspirone should be used with caution in patients with:<br> • acute narrow-angle
            glaucoma.<br> • myasthenia gravis.<br> • drug dependence.<br> • a history of hepatic or renal impairment.<br>            Monotherapy
            <br> Buspirone should not be used alone to treat depression, and may potentially mask the clinical signs of depression.<br>            Paediatric use<br> The long-term safety and effectiveness of buspirone have not been determined in individuals
            below 18 years of age. Buspirone is not recommended in children<br> and adolescents.<br> Drug abuse and dependence<br>            Buspirone is not a controlled substance.<br> Buspirone has shown no potential for drug abuse and dependence based
            on human and animal studies.<br> Potential for withdrawal reactions in sedative/hypnotic/anxiolytic drug-dependent
            patients<br> Because buspirone does not exhibit cross-tolerance with benzodiazepines and other common sedative/hypnotic
            drugs, it will not block the withdrawal syndrome <br> often seen with cessation of therapy with these drugs.
            Therefore, before starting therapy with buspirone, it is advisable to withdraw these drugs gradually,<br> especially
            in patients who have been using a CNS-depressant drug chronically.<br> Long-term toxicity<br> Because its mechanism
            of action is not fully elucidated, long-term toxicity in the CNS or other organ systems cannot be predicted.<br>            Lactose
            <br> Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose
            malabsorption should not take this product.<br>
            <b>Interactions</b><br> The concomitant use of buspirone with other CNS-active drugs should be approached with
            caution.<br>
            <b>Effect of other drugs on buspirone</b><br>
            <b>Association not recommended:</b><br> MAO inhibitors<br> Co-administration of MAO inhibitors may cause increases
            in blood pressure. Co-administration of MAO inhibitors and buspirone is therefore not recommended<br> (see Section
            Warnings and Precautions).<br> Erythromycin
            <br> Concomitant administration of buspirone (10 mg as single dose) and erythromycin (1.5 g once daily for four
            days) in healthy volunteers increased the plasma <br> concentrations of buspirone (Cmax increased 5-fold and
            AUC 6-fold). If buspirone and erythromycin are to be used in combination, a low dose of buspirone <br> (e.g.,
            2.5 mg twice daily) is recommended. Subsequent dose adjustments of either drug should be based on clinical response.<br>            Itraconazole
            <br> Concomitant administration of buspirone (10 mg as single dose) and itraconazole (200 mg once daily for four
            days) in healthy volunteers increased the plasma<br> concentrations of buspirone (Cmax increased 13-fold and
            AUC 19-fold). If buspirone and itraconazole are to be used in combination, a low dose of buspirone<br> (e.g.,
            2.5 mg once daily) is recommended. Subsequent dose adjustments of either drug should be based on clinical response.<br>
            <b>Association with precautions of use:</b><br> Diltiazem
            <br> Concomitant administration of buspirone (10 mg as single dose) and diltiazem (60 mg three times daily) in
            healthy volunteers increased the plasma<br> concentrations of buspirone (Cmax increased 5.3-fold and AUC 4-fold).
            Enhanced effects and increased toxicity of buspirone may be possible when buspirone<br> is administered with
            diltiazem. Subsequent dose adjustments of either drug should be based on clinical response.<br> Verapamil
            <br> Concomitant administration of buspirone (10 mg as single dose) and verapamil (80 mg three times daily) in
            healthy volunteers increased the plasma<br> concentrations of buspirone (Cmax and AUC increased 3.4-fold). Enhanced
            effects and increased toxicity of buspirone may be possible when buspirone is<br> administered with verapamil.
            Subsequent dose adjustments of either drug should be based on clinical response.<br> Rifampicin
            <br> Rifampicin induces the metabolism of buspirone via CYP3A4. Therefore, concomitant administration of buspirone
            (30 mg as single dose) and rifampicin (600<br> mg once daily for 5 days) in healthy volunteers decreased the
            plasma concentrations (Cmax decreased 84 % and AUC decreased 90 %) and the <br> pharmacodynamic effect of buspirone.<br>
            <b>Association with precautions of use:</b><br> Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI)<br> The combination
            of buspirone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) was tested in a number of clinical trials on
            more than 300,000 patients.<br> Although no severe toxicities were observed, there were rare cases of seizures
            in patients that took SSRI and buspirone concomitantly.<br> Separate cases of seizures in patients administered
            combination therapy with buspirone and SSRIs have been reported from regular clinical use.<br><br> Buspirone
            should be used with caution in combination with serotonergic drugs (including MAOIs, L-tryptophan, triptans,
            tramadol, linezolid, SSRIs, lithium <br> and St. John’s wort) as there are isolated reports of serotonin syndrome
            occurring in patients on concomitant SSRI therapy. If this condition is suspected,<br> treatment with buspirone
            should be immediately discontinued and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.<br> Protein binding<br>            Buspirone may displace less firmly protein-bound drugs like digoxin. The clinical significance of this property
            is unknown. In vitro studies have shown that <br> buspirone does not displace warfarin, digoxin, phenytoin, or
            propranolol from plasma proteins<br> Nefazodone
            <br> The coadministration of buspirone (2.5 or 5 mg twice daily) and nefazodone (250 mg twice daily) to healthy
            volunteers resulted in marked increases in plasma<br> buspirone concentrations (increases up to 20-fold in Cmax
            and up to 50-fold in AUC) and statistically significant decreases (about 50%) in plasma concentrations<br> of
            buspirone metabolite, 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine. With 5mg twice daily doses of buspirone, slight increases in AUC
            were observed for nefazodone (23%) and its<br> metabolites hydroxynefazodone (HO-NEF) (17%) and mCPP (9%). Slight
            increases in Cmax were observed for nefazodone (8%) and its metabolite HO-NEF (11%).<br> The side effect profile
            for subjects receiving buspirone 2.5 mg twice daily and nefazodone 250 mg twice daily was similar to that for
            subjects receiving either<br> drug alone. Subjects receiving buspirone 5 mg twice daily and nefazodone 250 mg
            twice daily experienced side effects such as lightheadedness, asthenia, dizziness,<br> and somnolence. It is
            recommended that the dose of buspirone be lowered when administered with nefazodone. Subsequent dose adjustments
            of either drug should be <br> based on clinical response.<br> Grapefruit juice<br> Concomitant administration
            of buspirone 10 mg and grapefruit juice (double strength 200 ml for 2 days) in healthy volunteers increased the
            plasma concentrations<br> of buspirone (Cmax increased 4.3-fold and AUC 9.2-fold).<br> Other Inhibitors and Inducers
            of CYP3A<sup>4</sup><br> When administered with a potent inhibitor of CYP3A<sup>4</sup>, a low dose of buspirone,
            used cautiously, is recommended. When used in combination with a potent <br> inducer of CYP3A4, e.g. phenobarbital,
            phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John’s wort, an adjustment of the dosage of buspirone may be necessary to maintain
            busprione's<br> anxiolytic effect.<br> Fluvoxamine
            <br> In short-term treatment with fluvoxamine and buspirone doubled buspirone plasma concentrations are observed
            compared to mono-therapy with buspirone.<br> Trazadone
            <br> Concomitant administration of trazadone showed a 3-6 fold increase of ALT in some patients.<br> Cimetidine
            <br> The concomitant use of buspirone and cimetidine has shown a slight increase in the 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine
            metabolite of Buspirone. Because of the high <br> protein binding of Buspirone (around 95%) caution is advised
            when drugs with a high protein binding are given concomitantly.<br> Baclofen, Lofexidine, Nabilone, Antihistamines<br>            Those drugs may enhance any sedative effect.<br>
            <b>Amitriptyline<br>
In healthy volunteers no interaction with the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline was seen<br>
Effect of buspirone on other drugs</b><br> Diazepam
            <br> After addition of buspirone to the diazepam dose regimen, no statistically significant differences in the
            steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC, and Cmin)<br> were observed for diazepam, but increases of
            about 15% were seen for nordiazepam, and minor adverse clinical effects (dizziness, headache, and nausea) were
            observed.<br> Haloperidol
            <br> Concomitant administration of haloperidol and buspirone can increase haloperidol serum levels.<br> Digoxin
            <br> In humans, approximately 95% of buspirone is plasma protein bound. In vitro, buspirone does not displace
            tightly bound drugs (ie warfarin) from serum proteins.<br> However, in vitro, buspirone may displace less firmly
            protein-bound drugs like digoxin. The clinical significance of this property is unknown.<br> Warfarin
            <br> There are reports on increases in the prothrombin time after the addition of buspiron to a treatment regimen
            containing warfarin.<br>
            <b>Pregnancy and Lactation</b><br> Fertility
            <br> There are no relevant data available.<br>
            <b>Pregnancy and Lactation</b><br> In some studies, administration of high doses of buspirone to pregnant animals
            produced effects on survival, birth and weaning weights, although there was no effect<br> on foetal development.
            Since the relevance of this finding in humans has not been established, buspirone is contraindicated in pregnancy
            and in lactation.<br>
            <b>Ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills</b><br> Buspirone has a moderate
            influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Attention should be drawn to the risks associated with drowsiness
            or dizziness induced by<br> this drug (see Section Adverse Reactions)<br>
            <b>Adverse Reactions</b><br>
            <b>Clinical Trial Data and Post Marketing Data</b><br> Side effects of buspirone, if they occur, are generally
            observed at the beginning of drug therapy and usually subside with use of the medication and/or decreased dosage.<br>            When patients receiving buspirone were compared with patients receiving placebo, dizziness, headache, nervousness,
            lightheaded-ness, nausea, excitement, and<br> sweating/clamminess were the only side effects occurring with significantly
            greater frequency (p &lt;0.10) in the buspirone group than in the placebo group.<br>
            <b>Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency.<br>

            <b>Overdosage><br>
Symptoms and signs</b<br>
In normal volunteers, the maximum tolerated dose of buspirone was 375 mg/day. As the maximum dose levels were approached,<br>
the most commonly observed symptoms were nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, restlessness,  miosis,<br>
and gastric distress.<br>
Mild bradycardia and hypotension have been reported. Extrapyramidal symptoms have been reported after therapeutic doses.<br>
Rarely convulsions may occur.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Treatment</b> There is no specific antidote to buspirone. Buspirone is not removed by haemodialysis.. Treatment
            should be symptomatic and <br> supportive as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre,
            where available. The ingestion of <br> multiple agents should be suspected.<br>
            <b>Clinical Pharmacology<br>
Pharmacodynamics<br>
Pharmacotherapeutic group</b><br> Anxiolytics: Azaspirodecanedione derivatives<br>
            <b>ATC Code</b><br> N05BE01
            <br>
            <b>Mechanism of Action and Pharmacodynamic effects</b><br> The exact mechanism of buspirone anxioselective action
            is not fully known. It does not act on benzodiazepine receptor sites<br> and lacks sedative, anticonvulsant and
            muscle relaxant properties. From animal studies it is known to interact with serotonin,<br> noradrenaline, acetylcholine
            and dopamine systems of the brain. Buspirone enhances the activity of specific noradrenergic and dopaminergic
            <br> pathways, whereas the activity of serotonin and acetylcholine are reduced.<br>
            <b>Pharmacokinetics<br>
Absorption<</b><br> Buspirone is rapidly absorbed when given orally. Systemic bioavailability is low because
            of extensive first-pass metabolism,<br> but may be increased if given with food as this delays absorption from
            the gastrointestinal tract and thereby reduces presystemic <br> clearance. Peak plasma levels occur 40-90 minutes
            after dosing.<br>
            <b>Distribution</b><br> Plasma concentration is linearly related to dose. Following multiple dosing, steady state
            plasma concentrations are achieved</b>
            within 2 days. Buspirone is 95% protein bound.</b>
            <b>Metabolism</b></b>
            Buspirone is metabolised primarily by oxidation which in vitro has been shown to be mediated by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)<br>            (see section Interactions), producing several hydroxylated derivatives and a pharmacologically active metabolite,
            1-pyrimidinyl piperazine (1-PP).<br>
            <b>Elimination</b><br> Buspirone is eliminated primarily by liver metabolism. In pharmacokinetic studies mean
            plasma half-lives varied from 2 to 11 hours.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Special patient populations<br>
Children</b><br> Across the dose range studied, the Cmax and AUC of 1- PP (the active metabolite of buspirone,
            1- pyrimidinylpiperazine) in children <br> were approximately double those of adults.<br>
            <b>Renal impairment</b><br> After multiple-dose administration of buspirone to renal impaired (Clcr = 10–70 mL/min/1.73
